## Overview

Create a portfolio web page to showcase coding skills and completed projects. Use Bootstrap CSS functions where possible (use placeholders where required for non complete content). 

Make sure the webpage is responsive, all links work etc. Columns, navigation and a Jumbotron should utilize Bootstrap capabilities.

Placeholders to be replaced as projects completed. Styling and text to be enhanced accordingly as time goes on.

This README.md file will be updated as the page becomes a real portfolio and ceases to be a challenge covering above points.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap Nav, Jumbotron, Column sections
- CSS custom properties
- Media queries
<br><br>
### What I learned

Using Bootstrap to define parts of the site allowed for quick CSS styling including responsiveness. I also learnt that although this is quick and certainly speeds development.....fine custom tweeks of these elements are required to perfect custom styling and great responsiveness across all device widths. Standard Bootstrap code is great.....but far from perfect.

### Continued development

This project will be ongoing and showcase my latest projects, skills and resume.
